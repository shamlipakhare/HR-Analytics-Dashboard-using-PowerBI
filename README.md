# HR Analytics Dashboard Using PowerBI


This project demonstrates my skill in using tools to analyze data and draw useful conclusions.

HR analytics is about understanding how to manage staff better to meet business goals. We look at important numbers about employees and why they might leave their jobs. I made reports about these numbers, helping the company figure out what they can do to keep more employees. I've also started finding out helpful information to guide the company in keeping their staff happy.


## Tools Used :

Power BI | Power Query | Dax Query
## Steps :

1) Cleaning and Analyzing using Power Query
2) Exploring and Manipulate Some Data Using DAX Query  
3) Power BI Dashboard Visualization
## Summary :

Analyzed employee data to identify trends and gained insights using Power Query and DAX in Power BI. Created an interactive dashboard to track employee performance and reasons for attrition. Discovered that salespeople are performing well comparatively to other departments. People from R&D department are leaving the company in greater numbers due to a lower salary and stagnant hike rates. Provided visualizations and actionable insights to the HR team to address the issue and retain employees.
